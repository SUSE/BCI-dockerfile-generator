## Description

SUSE Linux Enterprise Base Container Images (SLE BCI) provide truly open,
flexible, and secure container images and application development tools. The
images consist of container environments based on SUSE Linux Enterprise and
designed to be a secure base for any containerized workload.

SLE BCI is freely available, re-distributable, and supported across many
different environments. These templates and tools address modern, containerized
application development and CI/CD application containerization.  They can be
used immediately by developers and integrators without the “lock-in” imposed by
other offerings.

SLE BCI inherits industry-leading security and compliance from SUSE Linux
within your container build process. The container images are designed to be a
secure base for any application workload. SUSE ensures that compliance
standards are applied consistently and continuously improves security-related
capabilities.

SLE BCI is lightweight and easy to adopt, with the ability to run with any
Linux OS. Avoid lock-in imposed by other vendors and get exactly what you need,
fast. SLE BCI delivers a flexible developer experience that accounts for,
integrates with, and supports language-native tools and workflows.
