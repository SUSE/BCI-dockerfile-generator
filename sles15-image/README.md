## Description

SUSE Linux Enterprise Base Container Images provide open, flexible,
and secure container images. The images include container environments based on
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and are available at no cost, they can be freely
re-distributed, and they are supported across different environments.

The Base Container Image is an image used as a foundation for many SLE BCIs. The
image is intended to be extended for further use, such as a development or a
testing environment.


## Usage

The container image comes with the `zypper` package manager
, the free `SLE_BCI` repository
and the `container-suseconnect` utility. This allows you to access
the full SUSE Linux Enterprise Server repositories with a subscription. The image is designed
to be extended by installing packages required for your specific scenario.

To build a custom image using a `Containerfile` that includes the
[`skopeo`](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) utility, create the following
`Containerfile`:
```Dockerfile
FROM registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:15.6
RUN set -euo pipefail; \
    zypper -n ref; \
    zypper -n in skopeo; \
    zypper -n clean -a ; \
    rm -rf /var/log/{lastlog,tallylog,zypper.log,zypp/history,YaST2}
```

Then build the container using `buildah`:
```bash
buildah bud -t bci-skopeo .
```

The image can also be used interactively to create a container with skopeo
installed in it:
```ShellSession
$ podman run -ti --rm registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:15.6
# zypper -n in skopeo
...
# skopeo inspect -f "{{ .Name }}" docker://registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:15.6
registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base
```
### The SLE_BCI repository

The container image comes with the free `SLE_BCI` repository. The repository
provides the latest version of a subset of packages from SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.
These packages are available at no cost and can be freely redistributed.

### Getting access to the SLE repositories

The `container-suseconnect` utility in the image can automatically add the full
repositories into the running container if you have a valid
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server subscription.

Find more information about container-suseconnect in the
[`container-suseconnect`](https://documentation.suse.com/container/all/single-html/Container-guide/index.html#sec-container-suseconnect)
section in the container guide or in the tutorial ["How to use
container-suseconnect"](https://opensource.suse.com/bci-docs/guides/container-suseconnect/).
