# {{ image.pretty_name }} Container Image

{% include 'badges.j2' %}

## Description

[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose, open-source programming language. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.

## Usage

To deploy an application, install dependencies, copy the sources, and configure the application's main script:

```Dockerfile
FROM {{ image.pretty_reference }}

# displays an error message if Gemfile and Gemfile.lock are not in sync
RUN bundle config --global frozen 1

WORKDIR /app

COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./
RUN bundle install

COPY . .

CMD [ "ruby", "./main-script.rb" ]
```

Build and run the container image:

```ShellSession
$ podman build -t my-ruby-app .
$ podman run -it --rm my-ruby-app
```

The example above assumes that there is a `Gemfile.lock` file in the application directory.
To generate a `Gemfile.lock` file, use the following command:

```ShellSession
$ podman run --rm -v "$PWD":/app:Z -w /app {{ image.pretty_reference }} bundle lock
```

To run a single script inside a container, use the following command:

```ShellSession
$ podman run --rm -v "$PWD":/app:Z -w /app {{ image.pretty_reference }} ruby script.rb
```

## Encoding

The Ruby image sets the locale environment variable `LANG` to `C.UTF-8`.

## Additional tools

In addition to the standard SLE BCI development packages the following
additional tools are included in the image:

- gcc-c++
- make
- sqlite3-devel
- timezone
