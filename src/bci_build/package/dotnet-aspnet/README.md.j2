# {{ image.pretty_name }} container image

{% include 'badges.j2' %}

## Description

{% include 'dotnet_description.j2' %}

This image contains the ASP.NET Core and .NET runtimes and libraries,
and it is optimized for running ASP.NET Core applications in production.

{% include 'dotnet_notice.j2' %}

## Usage

To compile and deploy an application, copy the sources and build the binary:

```Dockerfile
FROM registry.suse.com/bci/dotnet-sdk:{{ image.version }} AS build
WORKDIR /source

# copy csproj and restore as distinct layers
COPY aspnetapp/*.csproj .
RUN dotnet restore

# copy and publish app and libraries
COPY aspnetapp/. .
RUN dotnet publish --no-restore -o /app

# final image
FROM {{ image.pretty_reference }}

WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app .

EXPOSE 8080

# uncomment to run as non-root user
# USER $APP_UID

ENTRYPOINT ["./aspnetapp"]
```

Build and run the container image:

```ShellSession
podman build -t my-aspnet-app .
podman run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 my-aspnet-app
```

## HTTPS and certificates

ASP.NET Core uses [HTTPS by default](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/enforcing-ssl).
You need a valid certificate for production deployments.

To create a self-signed certificate for testing, use the following command:

```ShellSession
podman run --rm -it -v "$PWD/https":/https:Z \
    {{ image.registry }}/bci/dotnet-sdk:{{ image.version }} \
    dotnet dev-certs https -ep /https/aspnetapp.pfx -p <PASSWORD>
```

To use a certificate and run the container image with ASP.NET Core configured for HTTPS in development or production, use the following command:

```ShellSession
podman run --rm -it -p 8081:8081 \
    -e ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORTS=8081 \
    -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password="<PASSWORD>" \
    -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=/https/aspnetapp.pfx \
    -v "$PWD/https":/https:Z my-apsnet-app
```
