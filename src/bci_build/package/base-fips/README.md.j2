## Description

{% if image.build_version | string == '15.3' %}
This SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP3 LTSS-based container image includes the
SLES 15 FIPS-140-2 certified OpenSSL and libgcrypt modules. The image is
designed to run on a FIPS-140-2 compliant SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP3
host environment. Although it is configured to enforce FIPS mode, the FIPS
certification requires a host kernel in FIPS mode to be fully compliant.

The [FIPS-140-2 certified OpenSSL module](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/documents/security-policies/140sp3991.pdf)
is a cryptographic module that provides a FIPS-140-2 compliant
cryptographic library. The module is certified by the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

The FIPS-140-2 certified OpenSSL module is a drop-in replacement for the
standard OpenSSL library. It provides the same functionality as the standard
OpenSSL library, with additional security features to meet the FIPS-140-2
requirements.

Similarly, the [FIPS-140-2 certified libgcrypt module](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/documents/security-policies/140sp3848.pdf)
is a drop-in replacement for the standard libgcrypt library. It provides the
same functionality as the standard libgcrypt library, with the additional
security features enforced to meet FIPS-140-2 requirements.
{% elif image.build_version | string == "15.4" %}
This SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP4 LTSS-based container image includes the
OpenSSL and libgcrypt modules that have been interim validated to FIPS 140-3.

The [FIPS 140-3 certified OpenSSL module](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/documents/security-policies/140sp4725.pdf)
is a cryptographic module that provides a FIPS 140-3 compliant cryptographic
library. The module is designed to provide the same functionality as the
standard OpenSSL library, with additional security features to meet the FIPS
140-3 requirements. [An interim validation has been issued](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/4725)
by NIST.

Similarly, the [FIPS 140-3 certified libgcrypt module](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/documents/security-policies/140sp4722.pdf)
is designed to provide the same functionality as the standard libgcrypt
library, with additional security features enforced to meet the FIPS 140-3
requirements. [An interim validation has been issued](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/4722)
by NIST.

{% else %}
This base container image is configured with FIPS mode enabled by default, but
**does not** include any certified binaries.
{% endif %}

## Usage
The image is configured to enforce the use of FIPS mode by default,
independent of the host environment setup by specifying the following
environment variables:
* `OPENSSL_FIPS=1`: Initialize the OpenSSL FIPS mode
* `OPENSSL_FORCE_FIPS_MODE=1`: Set FIPS mode to enforcing independent of the host kernel
* `LIBGCRYPT_FORCE_FIPS_MODE=1`: Set FIPS mode in libgcrypt to enforcing

Below is a list of other environment variables that can be used to configure the OpenSSL library:

* `OPENSSL_ENFORCE_MODULUS_BITS=1`: Restrict the OpenSSL module to only generate
the acceptable key sizes of RSA.
