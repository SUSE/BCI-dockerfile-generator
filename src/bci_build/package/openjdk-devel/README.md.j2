# {{ image.pretty_name }} container image

{% include 'badges.j2' %}

## Description

[OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/) (Open Java Development Kit) is a free and open source implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE). OpenJDK is the official reference implementation of Java SE since version 7.

The OpenJDK development image is intended to be used as a build environment. For runtime, use the OpenJDK runtime image.

## Usage

The default command for the image is the Java Shell tool (JShell).

```ShellSession
$ podman run -it --rm {{ image.pretty_reference }}
jshell> /help
```

To compile and deploy an application, copy the sources and build the binary:

```Dockerfile
# Build the application using the OpenJDK development image
FROM {{ image.pretty_reference }} as build

WORKDIR /app

COPY . ./

RUN javac Hello.java

# Bundle the application into OpenJDK runtime image
FROM registry.suse.com/bci/openjdk:{{ image.version }}

WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=build /app/Hello.class /app

CMD ["java", "Hello"]
```

Build and run the container image:

```ShellSession
$ podman build -t my-java-app .
$ podman run -it --rm my-java-app
```

There are situations, where you don't want to run an application inside a container.

To compile the application, without running it inside a container instance, use the following command:

```ShellSession
$ podman run --rm -v "$PWD":/app:Z -w /app {{ image.pretty_reference }} javac Hello.java
```

## Additional tools

The {{ image.pretty_name }} image includes [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) is available in the repositories.
