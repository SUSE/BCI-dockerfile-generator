## Description

.NET is a general purpose development platform.
It is cross-platform, and can be used in devices, cloud, and embedded/IoT scenarios.
You can use C# or F# to write .NET applications.

This image contains the ASP.NET Core and .NET runtimes and libraries,
and it is optimized for running ASP.NET Core applications in production.

## Notice

The .NET packages in the image come from a third-party repository 
[packages.microsoft.com](https://packages.microsoft.com).

The source code is available on [github.com/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet).

SUSE does not provide any support or warranties for the third-party components in the image.

## Usage

To compile and deploy an application, copy the sources and build the binary:

```Dockerfile
FROM registry.suse.com/bci/dotnet-sdk:9.0 AS build
WORKDIR /source

# copy csproj and restore as distinct layers
COPY aspnetapp/*.csproj .
RUN dotnet restore

# copy and publish app and libraries
COPY aspnetapp/. .
RUN dotnet publish --no-restore -o /app

# final image
FROM registry.suse.com/bci/dotnet-aspnet:9.0

WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app .

EXPOSE 8080

# uncomment to run as non-root user
# USER $APP_UID

ENTRYPOINT ["./aspnetapp"]
```

Build and run the container image:

```ShellSession
podman build -t my-aspnet-app .
podman run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 my-aspnet-app
```

## HTTPS and certificates

ASP.NET Core uses [HTTPS by default](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/enforcing-ssl).
You need a valid certificate for production deployments.

To create a self-signed certificate for testing, use the following command:

```ShellSession
podman run --rm -it -v "$PWD/https":/https:Z \
    registry.suse.com/bci/dotnet-sdk:9.0 \
    dotnet dev-certs https -ep /https/aspnetapp.pfx -p <PASSWORD>
```

To use a certificate and run the container image with ASP.NET Core configured for HTTPS in development or production, use the following command:

```ShellSession
podman run --rm -it -p 8081:8081 \
    -e ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORTS=8081 \
    -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password="<PASSWORD>" \
    -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=/https/aspnetapp.pfx \
    -v "$PWD/https":/https:Z my-apsnet-app
```

## Globalization

.NET includes [globalization](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/globalization-and-localization) capabilities, including support for processing natural language text, calendars, currency, and timezones. The .NET implementation for these capabilities is based on system libraries available in the container image, such as [International Components for Unicode (ICU)](https://icu.unicode.org/) and [tzdata](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database).

It's considered a good practice to pass timezone information into a container via environment variable `TZ`.

```bash
podman run --rm -it -e TZ="Europe/Berlin" app
```
