## Description

The `bci-micro` image includes the RPM database, but not the RPM package
manager. This means that the image is smaller than `bci-minimal`. The primary
use case for the image is deploying static binaries produced externally or
during multi-stage builds.

This base container image is configured with FIPS mode enabled by default, but
**does not** include any certified binaries.

## Usage

As there is no straightforward way to install additional
dependencies inside the container image, we recommend deploying a project
using the `bci-micro` image only when the final build artifact bundles all
dependencies and needs no further installation of packages.

Example using a Go application:

```Dockerfile
FROM registry.suse.com/bci/golang:stable as build

WORKDIR /app

RUN go install github.com/go-training/helloworld@latest

# Create an image to bundle the app
FROM registry.suse.com/bci/bci-micro-fips:16.1

COPY --from=build /go/bin/helloworld /usr/local/bin/helloworld

CMD ["/usr/local/bin/helloworld"]
```
